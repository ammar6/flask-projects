# First lecture

This is the first lecture of the course.

Every lecture should have a README.md which contains:

- A description of what the lecture is about
- What topics are covered
- Any resources that should be added to the lecture

The first lecture of a section should contain two folders: `start` and `end`, for the code at the beginning of the lecture, and the code at the end of the lecture.

Lectures other than the first lecture of a section do not need the starting code, since we'll assume they use the end code of the previous lecture.

## Topics

This will be a searchable list of topics so we can find lectures covering specific topics easily. Be as specific as possible, and include every topic you can think of that this lecture covers.

## Resources

- First resource
- Second resource
